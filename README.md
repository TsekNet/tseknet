## 👋 Hi, I'm Dan 

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=tseknet.tseknet)

I'm a Systems Administrator on the [WinOps SRE](https://github.com/google/winops) team at Google.

### What am I up to?

- 🔭 I’m currently working:
  - [Glazier](https://github.com/google/glazier): A Python-based Windows imaging tool developed at Google.
  - [Fresnel](https://github.com/google/fresnel): Allows operating system images to be retrieved and provisioned from anywhere with internet access.
- 📝 I’ve recently started a new [Blog](https://tseknet.com).
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make sysadmins, IT pros, and developers' lives easier.
- 💬 Ask me about PowerShell, Python, automation, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, imaging/provisioning, or anything related!
