## 👋 Hi, I'm Dan

I'm an Senior Staff Software Engineer at NVIDIA, with an unhealthy obsession for automation.

### What am I up to?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on designing, coding, and reliably deploying Windows Fleet management tooling for NVIDIA.
- 📝 I’ve started a [Blog](https://tseknet.com).
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make SRE, sysadmins, IT pros, and developer's lives easier.
- 💬 Ask me about PowerShell, Go, Python, automation, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, imaging/provisioning, or anything related!
